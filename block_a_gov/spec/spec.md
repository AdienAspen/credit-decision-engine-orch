# Spec v0.1 — Block A (Agentic Platform)

## Purpose
Given a credit request, emit a decision (approve/review/reject) with traceability and versioned artifacts.

## Inputs (contracts)
- Request Core (identity + minimal static/backbone payload)
- EFV v0.1 (from DS_Z: static + dyn sensor scores + source/latency maps)
- Sub-agent outputs (T2/T3/T4): score_* + thr_* + decision_* + meta_*
- BRMS flags (from Block B bridge)
- (Optional) Policies corpus for Reporter (RAG)

## Outputs
### Decision Pack v0.1 (structured)
Must include:
- meta_request_id, meta_generated_at
- efv_payload (efv_0.1)
- eligibility_result (pass/fail + reasons)
- risk_results (T2/T3/T4 outputs)
- brms_flags (rule_hits, flags)
- final_decision (approve/review/reject)
- reason_codes (structured, no free text)

### Report v0.1 (human-facing)
Generated by REPORTER from Decision Pack + policies (RAG). Reporter must NOT change the decision.

## Non-functional “Done”
- Determinism by request_id/seed when applicable
- Observability: logs + trace id + latency per step
- Missing-data handling: sensors may be null; system must degrade safely
- Versioning: v0.1 → v0.2 adds fields only (no breaking renames)

## Guardrails
- ORIGINATE never invents data; only uses declared inputs
- If conflicts/low confidence: escalate to REVIEW
