# Spec v0.1 — Block A (Agentic Platform)

## Purpose
Given a credit request, emit a decision (approve/review/reject) with traceability and versioned artifacts.

## Inputs (contracts)
- Request Core (identity + minimal static/backbone payload)
- EFV v0.1 (from DS_Z: static + dyn sensor scores + source/latency maps)
- Sub-agent outputs (T2/T3/T4): score_* + thr_* + decision_* + meta_*
- BRMS flags (from Block B bridge)
- (Optional) Policies corpus for Reporter (RAG)

## Outputs
### Decision Pack v0.1 (structured)
Must include:
- meta_request_id, meta_generated_at
- efv_payload (efv_0.1)
- eligibility_result (pass/fail + reasons)
- risk_results (T2/T3/T4 outputs)
- brms_flags (rule_hits, flags)
- final_decision (approve/review/reject)
- reason_codes (structured, no free text)

### Report v0.1 (human-facing)
Generated by REPORTER from Decision Pack + policies (RAG). Reporter must NOT change the decision.

## Non-functional “Done”
- Determinism by request_id/seed when applicable
- Observability: logs + trace id + latency per step
- Missing-data handling: sensors may be null; system must degrade safely
- Versioning: v0.1 → v0.2 adds fields only (no breaking renames)

## Guardrails
- ORIGINATE never invents data; only uses declared inputs
- If conflicts/low confidence: escalate to REVIEW

## System wiring v0.1 (ORIGINATE-centered)

### Inputs to ORIGINATE
- **Eligibility flag (Gate 0):** start/stop signal that authorizes the request to proceed.
- **Decision Pack:** `decision_pack_v0_1` assembled from T2/T3/T4 runner outputs (canonical aliases).
- **Sensor Pack:** dynamic sensor signals (e.g., market/behavior/device/bureau), normalized into a stable v0.1 payload.
- **BRMS flags:** business-rule signals (gates/warnings/overrides) fetched from Block B via API/MCP.

### Output from ORIGINATE
- **Final Decision bundle:** deterministic result + trace fields (request_id, sources, latencies).
- **REPORTER payload:** a structured input for REPORTER to generate narratives, reason codes, and audit-ready explanations.

### Directionality rule (important)
- ORIGINATE **consumes** BRMS signals from Block B.
- Block B is **not** a consumer of Block A ML scores in this PoC; it provides rule-based flags to ORIGINATE.
